# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to accurately recognize digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images, demonstrating fundamental deep learning techniques in image classification.
